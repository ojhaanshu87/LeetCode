Given an array nums sorted in ascending order, return true if and only if you can split it into 1 or more subsequences such that each subsequence consists of consecutive integers and has length at least 3.

 

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3
3, 4, 5
Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
3, 4, 5
Example 3:

Input: [1,2,3,4,4,5]
Output: False
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10000
```

#Greedy O(N) Time and O(N) Space

#Say we have a count of each number, and let tails[x] be the number of chains ending right before x.
#Now let's process each number. If there's a chain ending before x, then add it to that chain. Otherwise, if we can start a new chain, do so.


class Solution(object):
    def isPossible(self, nums):
        count = collections.Counter(nums)
        tails = collections.Counter()
        for x in nums:
            if count[x] == 0:
                continue
            elif tails[x] > 0:
                tails[x] -= 1
                tails[x+1] += 1
            elif count[x+1] > 0 and count[x+2] > 0:
                count[x+1] -= 1
                count[x+2] -= 1
                tails[x+3] += 1
            else:
                return False
            count[x] -= 1
        return True
