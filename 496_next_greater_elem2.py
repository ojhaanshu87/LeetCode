'''
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 both of unique elements, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.
Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.
The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, return -1 for this number.

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation:
For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation:
For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 104
All integers in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
All the integers of nums1 also appear in nums2.
 

Follow up: Could you find an O(nums1.length + nums2.length) solution?
